Sober Page Services
===================

``Sober Page`` attempts to provide a minimum standard for DNS, along with
recommendations for effective use, and training on that usage.

Domain Name
-----------

The primary purpose of ``Sober Page`` is to provide a domain name for 12-Step
groups so that they can have an easily accessible website using a standardized
URL pattern.

Short URL
---------

All ``sober.page`` URLs are also available via ``sobersupport.group``. This
serves as a convenient "Short URL" which should be easier for both memory and
document spacing.

Email Forward
-------------

Email forwarding is currently out of scope but may be considered in the future.
