Getting Started
===============

Make it clear that you should start at the top, work down, and thoroughly read
each page.

- We are here to serve as "the tech person" who can teach you how to deploy and maintain a website with both ease and transparency.
- You can reach us on discord (with reasonable response expectations)
- Tips for effectively using documentation (one page at a time--top to bottom)
  If feeling overwhelmed, don't read more than one page per day
- An explanation that the current reader (people we serve) will be expected to handle certain "user support" tasks
  Expectations include being responsible for meeting information (YOU are ultimately responsible for meeting accuracy)
- When to use specific support features / Where to report certain bugs (w/ note pointing toward bug triage)
- Our projects rely on git. You can copy our project to another service like GitLab and host a website there; however, our project has chosen GitHub as our collaboration platform.
  This mean that Issues against /our/ project must be reported in GitHub. We will continue to support any public website repository, regardless of where it is hosted.
