Core Principles

Our primary purpose is to support 12-Step Groups who are struggling to reach
those who still suffer. Above all else, we are lead by the 12th Step.

   Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to
   carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all
   our affairs."

Where our :ref:`Code of Coduct <conduct>` provides a standard of behavior and
ethical guidelines to help resolve disputes, this page provides guidelines to
help maintain alignment on mutual goals addressed by this project.

Documentation Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list provides some practical considerations that help define our audience:

- A common standard is "4th-grade reading level," but we should should for 3rd.
- Readers must be told **how** to copy an example file.
- Readers are extremely unlikely to look beyond our own documentation.
- Readers are extremely unlikely to search our documentation when facing issues.
- Those who follow along may be doing so from a mobile device (mobile-only user).
