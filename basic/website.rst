.. _hello-world:

Very Basic Site
===============

- Recap of Static vs. Dynamic w/ reference back to section in About Websites
- Note that our project scope is static site generators due to total cost of ownership and long-term maintenance requirements
- Recap of 2nd vs. 3rd-level domains
- Recap how/why services like github provide free hosting for websites (using <3rd>.github.io)
- We can use this "playground" repository to create an actual website.
- Tutorial: Does github support creating a website directly from markdown files? We could create 2-3 additional pages and link to them.
  The goal should be the minimum effort to get "Hello World" up on Github Pages.
