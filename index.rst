Recovery Source
===============

- We provide a set of projects (and other documentation) to help 12-step groups who are struggling with technology-based outreach.
- Recovery Source is a team that is driven by the 12th step; we do not accept donations from those whom we serve.
- What is a 12-step group (and AA)? (where/why it started)
