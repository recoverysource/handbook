Recovery Source
===============

**Recovery Source** provides a collection of tools that are meant to demystify
website maintenance, leaving :ref:`anyone <def-anyone>` with the skills required
to build, deploy, maintain, and support websites for :ref:`12-Step <def-12step>`
groups.

:ref:`Our goal <principles>` is to help 12-Step groups reach out to those who
are still suffering.

**What We Provide ...**

:ref:`Handbook <project>`
-------------------------

*This* ``Recovery Source Handbook`` is designed to take our :ref:`target audience
<audience>` from absolute beginner to a competent website administrator who is
able to support a website for their 12-Step group.

- :ref:`Get Started <start>`

The documentation provided here covers the breadth of our projects and provides
the foundational knowledge required to understand how websites work and how all
of the pieces fit together.

:ref:`Domain Services <domain>`
-------------------------------

The primary purpose of ``Sober Page`` is to offer a free :ref:`domain name
<def-domain>` and directory listing to 12-Step ``Sober Support Groups``,
allowing them to easily create a website and place it onto the internet using
a standardized URL format (ex. https\://**aa0**-**1**.sober.page for Area **0**,
District **1** of **A.A.**).

- https://sober.page/

This :ref:`domain solution <domain>` allows us to easily absorb the overhead
required to provide a :ref:`basic set of services <soberpage>`, which grants us
a tremendous amount of flexibility to resolve a wide variety of "common" issues.

With Sober Page, groups can avoid the cost and hassle of purchasing and naming
their own domain, or they use some of the services along with their own existing
domain.

:ref:`Website Template <template>`
----------------------------------

Our ``Website Template`` provides a "turn-key" website solution that enables you
to focus on little more than meeting accuracy. This removes many common stumbling
blocks that often lead to financially-problematic results.

- https://template-demo.recoverysource.net

Unlike website builders (wix, shopify, squarespace, etc.) or content management
systems (wordpress, drupal, etc.), our solution is based on a :ref:`Static Site
Generator (SSG) <def-ssg>`, which means there are many options for no-cost
website hosting.

:ref:`AAMod Plugin <aamod>`
---------------------------

The real heavy lifter behind our ``Website Template`` is ``AAMod``; this improves
accessibility and adds website features designed for 12-Step sites.

- https://aamod-demo.recoverysource.net

This plugin adds many extra features, including automatic generation of foldable
meeting schedule (PDF).

Our goal is for :ref:`this handbook <start>` to serve all of your educational
needs; if something is missing or explained poorly, we certainly want about it.

Not all things can be answered in documentation, especially if you would like us
to help with maintenance tasks; our `Discord Link`_ is ``Open`` to all.
