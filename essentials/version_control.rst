About Version Control
=====================

- What is version control
- Git vs. Github
- Git is a type of version control that enables de-centralized collaboration of (mostly) text files
- De-centralized means that the entire "repository" can be copied to your computer and synchronized only when you want to "push" a change--there are no "global file locks"
- This means it is easy for anyone across the internet to make their own copy, play around with changes, and then share the improvements.
